            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Home-based IoT devices have a bleak reputation regarding their security practices. On the surface, the insecurities of IoT devices seem to be caused by integration problems that may be addressed by simple measures, but this work finds that to be a naive assumption. The truth is, IoT deployments, at their core, utilize traditional compute systems, such as embedded, mobile, and network. These components have many unexplored challenges such as the effect of over-privileged mobile applications on embedded devices.</p>
               <p>Our work proposes a methodology that researchers and practitioners could employ to analyze security properties for home-based IoT devices. We systematize the literature for homebased IoT using this methodology in order to understand attack techniques, mitigations, and stakeholders. Further, we evaluate 45 devices to augment the systematized literature in order to identify neglected research areas. To make this analysis transparent and easier to adapt by the community, we provide a public portal to share our evaluation data and invite the community to contribute their independent findings.</p>

               <p>The Domain Name System is a critical piece of infrastructure that has expanded into use cases beyond its original intent. DNS TXT records are intentionally very permissive in what information can be stored there, and as a result are often used in broad and undocumented ways to support Internet security and networked applications. In this paper, we identified and categorized the patterns in TXT record use from a representative collection of resource record sets. We obtained the records from a data set containing 1.4 billion TXT records collected over a 2 year period and used pattern matching to identify record use cases present across multiple domains. We found that 92% of these records generally fall into 3 categories; protocol enhancement, domain verification, and resource location. While some of these records are required to remain public, we discovered many examples that unnecessarily reveal domain information or present other security threats (e.g., amplification attacks) in conflict with best practices in security.</p>

               <p>In-browser cryptojacking is a form of resource abuse that leverages end-users’ machines to mine cryptocurrency without obtaining the users’ consent. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Outguard, an automated cryptojacking detection system. We construct a large ground-truth dataset, extract several features using an instrumented web browser, and ultimately select seven distinctive features that are used to build an SVM classification model.  Outguard achieves a 97.9% TPR and 1.1% FPR and is reasonably tolerant to adversarial evasions. We utilized Outguard in the wild by deploying it across the Alexa Top 1M websites and found 6,302 cryptojacking sites, of which 3,600 are new detections that were absent from the training data. These cryptojacking sites paint a broad picture of the cryptojacking ecosystem, with particular emphasis on the prevalence of cryptojacking websites and the shared infrastructure that provides clues to the operators behind the cryptojacking phenomenon.</p>

               <p>The Mirai botnet, composed primarily of embedded and IoT devices, took the Internet by storm in late 2016 when it overwhelmed several high-profile targets with massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we provide a seven-month retrospective analysis of Mirai’s growth to a peak of 600k infections and a history of its DDoS victims. By combining a variety of measurement perspectives, we analyze how the botnet emerged, what classes of devices were affected, and how Mirai variants evolved and competed for vulnerable hosts. Our measurements serve as a lens into the fragile ecosystem of IoT devices. We argue that Mirai may represent a sea change in the evolutionary development of botnets—the simplicity through which devices were infected and its precipitous growth, demonstrate that novice malicious techniques can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even some of the best-defended targets.  To address this risk, we recommend technical and nontechnical interventions, as well as propose future research directions.</p>

            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Domain squatting is a common adversarial practice where attack- ers register domain names that are purposefully similar to popular domains. In this work, we study a specific type of domain squatting called “combosquatting,” in which attackers register domains that combine a popular trademark with one or more phrases (e.g., bet- terfacebook[.]com, youtube-live[.]com). We perform the first large- scale, empirical study of combosquatting by analyzing more than 468 billion DNS records—collected from passive and active DNS data sources over almost six years. We find that almost 60% of abusive combosquatting domains live for more than 1,000 days, and even worse, we observe increased activity associated with combosquat- ting year over year. Moreover, we show that combosquatting is used to perform a spectrum of different types of abuse including phishing, social engineering, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even advanced persistent threats. Our results suggest that com- bosquatting is a real problem that requires increased scrutiny by the security community.</p>

            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Both the operational and academic security communities have used dynamic analysis sandboxes to execute malware samples for roughly a decade. Network information derived from dynamic analysis is frequently used for threat detection, network policy, and incident response. Despite these common and important use cases, the efficacy of the network detection signal derived from such analysis has yet to be studied in depth. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing the network communications of 26.8 million samples that were collected over a period of five years.</p>
               <p>Using several malware and network datasets, our large scale study makes three core contributions. (1) We show that dynamic analysis traces should be carefully curated and provide a rigorous methodology that analysts can use to remove potential noise from such traces. (2) We show that Internet miscreants are increasingly using potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that rely on a surprisingly stable DNS and IP infrastructure. This indicates that the security community is in need of better protections against such threats, and network policies may provide a solid foundation for such protections. (3) Finally, we see that, for the vast majority of malware samples, network traffic provides the earliest indicator of infection—several weeks and often months before the malware sample is discovered. Therefore, network defenders should rely on automated malware analysis to extract indicators of compromise and not to build early detection systems.</p>

            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Most modern cyber crime leverages the Domain Name Sys- tem
               (DNS) to attain high levels of network agility and make
               detection of Internet abuse challenging. The majority of
               malware, which represent a key component of illicit Internet
               operations, are programmed to locate the IP address of their
               command-and-control (C&C) server through DNS lookups. To make
               the malicious infrastructure both agile and resilient, malware
               authors often use sophisticated communication methods that
               utilize DNS (i.e., domain generation algorithms) for their
               campaigns. In general, Internet miscreants make extensive use of
               short-lived disposable domains to promote a large variety of
               threats and support their criminal network operations.</p>
               <p>To effectively combat Internet abuse, the security community
               needs ac- cess to freely available and open datasets. Such
               datasets will enable the development of new algorithms that can
               enable the early detection, track- ing, and overall lifetime of
               modern Internet threats. To that end, we have created a system,
               Thales, that actively queries and collects records for massive
               amounts of domain names from various seeds. These seeds are
               collected from multiple public sources and, therefore, free of
               privacy con- cerns. The results of this effort will be opened
               and made freely available to the research community. With three
               case studies we demonstrate the detection merit that the
               collected active DNS datasets contain. We show that (i) more
               than 75% of the domain names in PBL appear in our datasets
               several weeks (and some cases months) in advance, (ii) existing
               DNS research can implemented using only active DNS, and (iii)
               malicious campaigns can be identified with the signal provided
               by active DNS.</p>

               <p>Domains are frequently used as trust anchors, but any individual that
               re-registers an expired domain implicitly inherits the residual trust
               associated with the domain's prior use.  We find that adversaries can, and do,
               use malicious re-registration to exploit domain ownership changes&mdash;undermining
               the security of both users and systems.  In fact, we find that many seemingly
               disparate security problems share a root cause in residual domain trust abuse.
               With this study we shed light on the seemingly unnoticed problem of residual
               domain trust by measuring the scope and growth of this abuse over the past six
               years.  During this time, we identified 27,758 domains from public blacklists
               and 238,279 domains resolved by malware that expired and then were maliciously
               re-registered. To help address this problem, we propose a technical remedy and
               discuss several policy remedies. For the former, we develop Alembic, a
               lightweight algorithm that uses only passive observations from the Domain Name
               System (DNS) to flag potential domain ownership changes. Using this algorithm,
               we identify several instances of residual trust abuse, including an expired APT
               domain that was available for immediate re-registration.</p>

               <p>Garbled circuits offer a powerful primitive for computation
               on a user’s personal data while keeping that data private.
               Despite recent improvements, constructing and evaluating
               circuits of any useful size remains expensive on the limited
               hardware resources of a smartphone, the primary computational
               device available to most users around the world. In this work,
               we develop a new technique for securely outsourcing the
               generation of garbled circuits to a Cloud provider. By
               outsourcing the circuit generation, we are able to eliminate
               the most costly operations from the mobile device, including
               oblivious transfers. After proving the security of our
               techniques in the malicious model, we experimentally demonstrate
               that our new protocol, built on this role reversal, decreases
               execution time by 98% and reduces network costs by as much as
               92% compared to previous outsourcing protocols. In so doing,
               we demonstrate that the use of garbled circuits on mobile
               devices can be made nearly as practical as it is becoming for
               server-class machines.</p>

               <p>Much of the attention surrounding mobile malware has focused on
               the in-depth analysis of malicious applications. While bringing
               the community valuable information about the methods used and
               data targeted by malware writers, such work has not yet been
               able to quantify the prevalence with which mobile devices are
               actually infected. In this paper, we present the first such
               attempt through a study of the hosting infrastructure used by
               mobile applications.  Using DNS traffic collected over the
               course of three months from a major US cellular provider as well
               as a major US non-cellular Internet service provider, we
               identify the DNS domains looked up by mobile applications, and
               analyze information related to the Internet hosts pointed to by
               these domains. We make several important observations. The
               mobile malware found by the research community thus far appears
               in a minuscule number of devices in the network: 3,492 out of
               over 380 million (less than 0.0009%) observed during the course
               of our analysis. This result lends credence to the argument
               that, while not perfect, mobile application markets are
               currently providing adequate security for the majority of mobile
               device users. Second, we find that users of iOS devices are
               virtually identically as likely to communicate with known low
               reputation domains as the owners of other mobile platforms,
               calling into question the conventional wisdom of one platform
               demonstrably providing greater security than another. Finally,
               we observe two malware campaigns from the upper levels of the
               DNS hierarchy and analyze the lifetimes and network properties
               of these threats. We also note that one of these campaigns
               ceases to operate long before the malware associated with it is
               discovered suggesting that network-based countermeasures may be
               useful in the identification and mitigation of future threats.</p>

               <p>An important component of network resource management and
               security enforcement is recognizing the applications active on a
               network. Unfortunately payload encryption and the use of
               non-standard ports render traditional application identification
               methods marginally useful. Newer in-the-dark application discovery
               methods can contend with these conditions, but still rely on packet
               level information that may not be readily available to
               administrators.</p>
               <p>This paper describes the initial findings and future directions
               of a technique that uses network motifs (e.g. overrepresented
               interaction subgraphs) to identify network activity. Modeling the
               flow-level network interactions as a graph, the proposed approach
               identifies sets of frequently occurring subgraphs useful to infer
               the applications. Initial results show this approach can achieve an
               average accuracy of 85% in mapping motifs to applications. We argue
               that performance can be improved by incorporating features into
               motifs that provide information about vertices and edges while
               preserving the ability for system administrators to gather such
               feature information from flow-level traces. Specific issues that
               arise in the collection of computer network interaction data and in
               dealing with the scale of such data are also highlighted.</p>
