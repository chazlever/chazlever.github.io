            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Most modern cyber crime leverages the Domain Name Sys- tem
               (DNS) to attain high levels of network agility and make
               detection of Internet abuse challenging. The majority of
               malware, which represent a key component of illicit Internet
               operations, are programmed to locate the IP address of their
               command-and-control (C&C) server through DNS lookups. To make
               the malicious infrastructure both agile and resilient, malware
               authors often use sophisticated communication methods that
               utilize DNS (i.e., domain generation algorithms) for their
               campaigns. In general, Internet miscreants make extensive use of
               short-lived disposable domains to promote a large variety of
               threats and support their criminal network operations.</p>
               <p>To effectively combat Internet abuse, the security community
               needs ac- cess to freely available and open datasets. Such
               datasets will enable the development of new algorithms that can
               enable the early detection, track- ing, and overall lifetime of
               modern Internet threats. To that end, we have created a system,
               Thales, that actively queries and collects records for massive
               amounts of domain names from various seeds. These seeds are
               collected from multiple public sources and, therefore, free of
               privacy con- cerns. The results of this effort will be opened
               and made freely available to the research community. With three
               case studies we demonstrate the detection merit that the
               collected active DNS datasets contain. We show that (i) more
               than 75% of the domain names in PBL appear in our datasets
               several weeks (and some cases months) in advance, (ii) existing
               DNS research can implemented using only active DNS, and (iii)
               malicious campaigns can be identified with the signal provided
               by active DNS.</p>

               <p>Domains are frequently used as trust anchors, but any individual that
               re-registers an expired domain implicitly inherits the residual trust
               associated with the domain's prior use.  We find that adversaries can, and do,
               use malicious re-registration to exploit domain ownership changes&mdash;undermining
               the security of both users and systems.  In fact, we find that many seemingly
               disparate security problems share a root cause in residual domain trust abuse.
               With this study we shed light on the seemingly unnoticed problem of residual
               domain trust by measuring the scope and growth of this abuse over the past six
               years.  During this time, we identified 27,758 domains from public blacklists
               and 238,279 domains resolved by malware that expired and then were maliciously
               re-registered. To help address this problem, we propose a technical remedy and
               discuss several policy remedies. For the former, we develop Alembic, a
               lightweight algorithm that uses only passive observations from the Domain Name
               System (DNS) to flag potential domain ownership changes. Using this algorithm,
               we identify several instances of residual trust abuse, including an expired APT
               domain that was available for immediate re-registration.</p>

            <div class="abstract">
               <p>Garbled circuits offer a powerful primitive for computation
               on a user’s personal data while keeping that data private.
               Despite recent improvements, constructing and evaluating
               circuits of any useful size remains expensive on the limited
               hardware resources of a smartphone, the primary computational
               device available to most users around the world. In this work,
               we develop a new technique for securely outsourcing the
               generation of garbled circuits to a Cloud provider. By
               outsourcing the circuit generation, we are able to eliminate
               the most costly operations from the mobile device, including
               oblivious transfers. After proving the security of our
               techniques in the malicious model, we experimentally demonstrate
               that our new protocol, built on this role reversal, decreases
               execution time by 98% and reduces network costs by as much as
               92% compared to previous outsourcing protocols. In so doing,
               we demonstrate that the use of garbled circuits on mobile
               devices can be made nearly as practical as it is becoming for
               server-class machines.</p>

               <p>Much of the attention surrounding mobile malware has focused on
               the in-depth analysis of malicious applications. While bringing
               the community valuable information about the methods used and
               data targeted by malware writers, such work has not yet been
               able to quantify the prevalence with which mobile devices are
               actually infected. In this paper, we present the first such
               attempt through a study of the hosting infrastructure used by
               mobile applications.  Using DNS traffic collected over the
               course of three months from a major US cellular provider as well
               as a major US non-cellular Internet service provider, we
               identify the DNS domains looked up by mobile applications, and
               analyze information related to the Internet hosts pointed to by
               these domains. We make several important observations. The
               mobile malware found by the research community thus far appears
               in a minuscule number of devices in the network: 3,492 out of
               over 380 million (less than 0.0009%) observed during the course
               of our analysis. This result lends credence to the argument
               that, while not perfect, mobile application markets are
               currently providing adequate security for the majority of mobile
               device users. Second, we find that users of iOS devices are
               virtually identically as likely to communicate with known low
               reputation domains as the owners of other mobile platforms,
               calling into question the conventional wisdom of one platform
               demonstrably providing greater security than another. Finally,
               we observe two malware campaigns from the upper levels of the
               DNS hierarchy and analyze the lifetimes and network properties
               of these threats. We also note that one of these campaigns
               ceases to operate long before the malware associated with it is
               discovered suggesting that network-based countermeasures may be
               useful in the identification and mitigation of future threats.</p>

               <p>An important component of network resource management and
               security enforcement is recognizing the applications active on a
               network. Unfortunately payload encryption and the use of
               non-standard ports render traditional application identification
               methods marginally useful. Newer in-the-dark application discovery
               methods can contend with these conditions, but still rely on packet
               level information that may not be readily available to
               administrators.</p>
               <p>This paper describes the initial findings and future directions
               of a technique that uses network motifs (e.g. overrepresented
               interaction subgraphs) to identify network activity. Modeling the
               flow-level network interactions as a graph, the proposed approach
               identifies sets of frequently occurring subgraphs useful to infer
               the applications. Initial results show this approach can achieve an
               average accuracy of 85% in mapping motifs to applications. We argue
               that performance can be improved by incorporating features into
               motifs that provide information about vertices and edges while
               preserving the ability for system administrators to gather such
               feature information from flow-level traces. Specific issues that
               arise in the collection of computer network interaction data and in
               dealing with the scale of such data are also highlighted.</p>
